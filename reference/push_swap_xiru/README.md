1. Calculate average value dynamicly, if the first node is a is below average, push to b, otherwise, rotate to the bottom. Repeat till 5 nodes are left in stack a.
2. Using linked list, each node in b will have the "target" in a, "target" is the node in a which contains the smallest bigger number than the node in stack b. Thus, when we push b to a, the smaller value will be on top of the bigger one.
